    summary: Perform path based lookup of nodes in the Flywheel hierarchy
    description: |
      This will perform a deep lookup of a node (i.e. group/project/session/acquisition) and its children,
      including any files. The query path is an array of strings in the following order (by default):

        * group id
        * project label
        * session label
        * acquisition label

      Additionally, analyses for project/session/acquisition nodes can be resolved by inserting the literal 
      string `"analyses"`. e.g. `['scitran', 'MyProject', 'analyses']`.

      Files for projects, sessions, acquisitions and analyses can be resolved by inserting the literal string 
      `"files"`. e.g. `['scitran', 'MyProject', 'files']`.

      An ID can be used instead of a label by formatting the string as `<id:project_id>`. The full path
      to the node, and the node's children will be included in the response.
