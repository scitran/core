      Files can be downloaded directly from this endpoint with a valid "Authorization" header or via a ticket id.

      To generate a ticket:
        - Make a request with an empty "ticket" parameter and a valid "Authorization" header. The server will respond with a generated ticket id.
        - Make another request with the received ticket id in the "ticket" parameter. A valid "Authorization" header is no longer required.

      When "view" is true, [RFC7233](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233) range request headers are supported.
