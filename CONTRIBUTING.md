1. Follow commit message guidelines.
1. Use `git rebase [-i]` to clean up your contribution and resolve pending merge conflicts.
1. Submit a pull request and ensure that CI passes.


## Code Standards
### Docstrings
- Use [Google Style Docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
- Add docstrings to all functions with a one-line description of its purpose.

### Format
Ensure that `./test/lint.sh api` exists without errors.


## Adding an API Resource
### Design Resource
1. Write a description of your API resource and its business functionality.
1. Choose a descriptive name for your resource that aligns with existing names.
1. Create a URL from the name. If your resource is a collection, the name should be a pluralized noun, e.g., "files".

### Add RAML for API Endpoints
1. Create a new resource file, called `<resource_name>.raml`, e.g., `files.raml`. Create this file in the `raml/resources` directory.
1. In `api.raml`, add a line with the URL of your resource and an include directive for your resource raml file, e.g., `/files: !include resources/files.raml`.
1. In your resource file, define your resource. Begin by adding a `description` property with the description you wrote in step 1.
1. Add example properties for both request and response. Examples should be stored in the `examples/` directory, e.g., `raml/examples/request/files.json`.
1. Use [JSONSchema.net](http://jsonschema.net/) to generate a JSON schema for both request and response body. Edit the schema as necessary. Before generating your schema, scroll down and uncheck "allow additional properties".  Schemas are stored in the `schemas/` directory, e.g., `raml/schemas/input/files.json`.

### Testing
Follow the procedures outlined in our [testing instructions](https://github.com/scitran/core/blob/master/TESTING.md).
